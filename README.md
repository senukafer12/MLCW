# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project explores different **machine learning algorithms** to classify whether a breast tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).

The work is presented across **three Jupyter notebooks** and a final report.
